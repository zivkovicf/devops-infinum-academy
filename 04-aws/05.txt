RDS -> create database

Filling form
Choose a database creation method  -> standard create
Engine options -> postgresql
templates -> free tier
fill db identifier, root user and pw
Instance configuration -> db.t3.micro
storage -> general purpose SSG (gp2) 200gb
Connectivity -> connect to EC2 resource
select ec2 instance

CREATE DB

after rds is up, install postgresql cli and connect to rds db
psql    --host=database-1.cxopxltsbucg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com    --port=5432    --username=postgres    --password
create new user, and new database. Grant access to new user on new database.

update ConnectionStrings__MoviesDb to use rds with new user and new db and create new container. 

To test, added new movie and restarted container. All movies are present, but images are gone. Next step is to connect S3 bucket to persist images :)
